# Data Structures & Algorithms

A collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implementations in Python and JavaScript.

## About

This repository contains my implementations of common data structures and algorithms as I learn and practice DSA concepts. Each topic includes code examples in both Python and JavaScript to help understand the concepts in different programming paradigms.

## Structure

```
├── topic-name/
│   ├── code.py
│   └── code.js
|── README.md
```

Each topic folder contains:
- Python implementation
- JavaScript implementation
- Comments explaining the logic

## Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
<!-- - Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Graphs
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- And more... -->

## Why This Repo?

- **Learn by doing**: Writing implementations helps solidify understanding
- **Language comparison**: See how the same concept works in Python vs JavaScript
- **Reference**: Quick lookup for common patterns and solutions
- **Practice**: Useful for interview preparation and problem-solving

## How to Use

1. Browse through the topic folders
2. Each folder has implementations in both languages
3. Read the code and comments to understand the approach
4. Run the code locally to see it in action
5. Feel free to use these as reference for your own learning

## Running the Code

**Python:**
```bash
python topic-name/code.py
```

**JavaScript:**
```bash
node  topic-name/code.js
```
